# Project Status for Agents

This document is for AI agents working on this project.

## Project Overview

This is a GLPI plugin that integrates with OpenRouter to provide automated responses to user tickets using Large Language Models (LLMs).

## Current Status

-   The core functionality of the plugin is implemented and considered production-ready.
-   The plugin includes a configuration page, ticket/followup processing, error logging, and a build pipeline.
-   The `README.md` file has been updated with detailed information for users.

## Development Guidelines

-   Follow the GLPI plugin development documentation.
-   Ensure all user-facing strings are translatable.
-   Maintain the existing code style and quality.

## Current Task

The main development phase is complete. The current focus is on documentation and finalization.
The next steps, as outlined in the `README.md` roadmap, are:
-   Adding unit tests.
-   Allowing customization of the system prompt from the UI.
-   Adding support for more LLM providers.
-   Improving logging and loop prevention further.
